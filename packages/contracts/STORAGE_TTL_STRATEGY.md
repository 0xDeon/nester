# Nester Soroban Storage Strategy & TTL Architecture

## 1. Overview

In Soroban, every storage entry pays ongoing rent. An entry whose TTL reaches
zero is archived (persistent / instance) or deleted (temporary). This document
describes the storage types currently used across Nester's deployable contracts
and the TTL extension behaviour that is **actually implemented**.

## 2. Storage Classification Matrix

| Contract | DataKey / Storage Entry | Storage Type | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`VaultContract`** | `DataKey::Token` | `Instance` | Checked by `require_initialized` (`vault/src/lib.rs:704`) |
| **`VaultContract`** | `DataKey::Status` | `Instance` | Vault pause state |
| **`VaultContract`** | Lock positions (`DataKey::Lock*`) | `Persistent` | Extend-on-access; see §3 |
| **`VaultTokenContract`** | Balances, allowances | `Persistent` | Managed by token contract |
| **`YieldRegistryContract`** | Source registry entries | `Instance` / `Persistent` | |
| **`NesterContract`** | `DataKey::Version`, admin state | `Instance` | |
| **`AllocationStrategyContract`** | Allocation weights | `Instance` | |

## 3. TTL Extension — What the Code Actually Does

### 3.1 Lock-entry TTL (vault only)

The only `extend_ttl` calls in the vault today are for **lock-position entries**
(`vault/src/lib.rs:1768`, `1778`, `1793`):

```rust
// vault/src/lib.rs:1755-1756
const LOCK_TTL_THRESHOLD: u32 = 1_000;
const LOCK_TTL_EXTEND_TO: u32 = 10_000;

// vault/src/lib.rs:1768
env.storage().persistent().extend_ttl(&key, LOCK_TTL_THRESHOLD, LOCK_TTL_EXTEND_TO);
```

These extend lock-position entries by ~10,000 ledgers (~0.6 days at 5 s/ledger)
whenever a lock is settled or queried. This is intentionally short because locks
have a bounded natural lifetime.

### 3.2 `require_initialized` does NOT extend TTL

The `require_initialized` helper (`vault/src/lib.rs:704`) only **checks** that
`DataKey::Token` is set in instance storage — it does not call `extend_ttl`:

```rust
// vault/src/lib.rs:704-708
fn require_initialized(env: &Env) {
    if !env.storage().instance().has(&DataKey::Token) {
        panic_with_error!(env, ContractError::NotInitialized);
    }
}
```

Instance storage TTL extension on user interactions is **not yet implemented**.
This is a known gap — if the vault becomes dormant, instance storage can expire.
Tracked as a follow-up to issue #1220.

### 3.3 No `TTL_BUMP_THRESHOLD_LEDGERS` / `TTL_EXTEND_TO_LEDGERS` constants

The previous version of this document described two named constants
(`TTL_BUMP_THRESHOLD_LEDGERS = 120_960`, `TTL_EXTEND_TO_LEDGERS = 518_400`).
**These constants do not exist** anywhere in the codebase today. The only TTL
constants live locally in `vault/src/lib.rs:1755-1756` (see §3.1).

---

## 4. Rent Cost Reference

| Storage type | Approx. cost (Soroban) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Instance (global vault state, ~1-2 KB) | ~0.0006 XLM / month |
| Persistent per-user position (160 B) | ~0.00008 XLM / month |

Figures are illustrative; actual rent rates depend on the current network fee
schedule. Because instance TTL auto-extension is not implemented, operators
should monitor instance TTL directly and bump manually until the auto-extension
feature ships.

---

## 5. Verification

End-to-end TTL tests added under issue #1220 live in
`tests/integration/src/integration/lifecycle_tests.rs` and assert that user
balances survive a large ledger-sequence advance. Those tests are run by
`cargo test -p nester-integration-tests` (no filter) -- see
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `contracts` job, step "Run integration tests".
